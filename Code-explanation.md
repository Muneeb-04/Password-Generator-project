In this piece of code, I created a random password generator which would create a random password based on the requirements chosen by the user. The user is prompted to input the desired minimum length for the password and whether they want to include numbers and special characters. The code uses a character set called 'characters', containing letters initially. I then created two other sets called, 'digits' which contains numbers, and 'special' which contains special characters. If the user opted for numbers, the 'digits' set is added to 'characters', and if they chose special characters, the 'special' set is included as well. This ensures that the password may include numbers and/or special characters as requested. The password generation works within a 'while' loop, which keeps generating random characters from the 'characters' set and adding them to the 'pwd' ('Print Working Directory') until certain conditions are met. To meet the user's criteria, the code checks if the generated password contains at least one number and one special character. Once the password meets the specified requirements or reaches the minimum length, the loop stops, and the final password is displayed.
